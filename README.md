# Image Generation
This repository contains different methods for generating new images.

### Image Generation Using Multivariate Gaussian Distribution 
We can make our model to generate new images by learning a multivariate gaussian distribution, the parameters for the model that are mean and covariance will be same as the mean of the data for that class and covariance of the data. <br>
I trained my model on MNIST digit data. The code can be found in __bayes.py__
